# How to get started

## Install using PolyMC / MultiMC

This method is by far the easiest. Follow the instructions for your operating system at [https://polymc.org/download/](https://polymc.org/download/) to install PolyMC.

First, sign in with your Microsoft account using the "add account" button in the upper right corner.

You will be prompted to go to a link where you will link your Microsoft account to PolyMC, once you've done that, we can move on.

Click on "add instance" in the upper right corner, select "CurseForge" from the options menu on the left, and in the search box search for Farwater.

To install Farwater season six for example, make sure it is selected in the bottom right corner on the "version selected" drop down. **Make sure this is the latest version! You will not be able to join the server otherwise.** Next, you will be prompted to install some mods manually, download those separately and place them into your mods folder. To access the mod folder, select Farwater in the main window, and on the right panel, click "view mods". Drag and drop the downloaded mods, (they should end with .jar) into the folder.

That's it! You should be ready to join the server.
