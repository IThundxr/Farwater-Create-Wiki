# How to claim land? Add friends?

Open the map and right click a chunk, a drop down menu should appear allowing you to claim the chunk. If you can't open your map, see  [how-to-rebind-keys.md](how-to-rebind-keys.md "mention")to learn how to rebind your map key.

In order to add friends to your claims, you must first create a party.

```
/openpac-parties create
```

To add someone to your party, use

```
/openpac-parties member invite yourfriendsusername
```

To edit party settings, open up the parties and claims menu (by default it is bound to quotation mark / apostrophe on your keyboard).
