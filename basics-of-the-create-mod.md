# Basics of The Create Mod

Farwater includes create 0.5 and additional mods as of Season 6. Some notable changes from earlier versions of create are the inclusions of [trains](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Create\_Mod\_Wiki), [steam engines](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Steam\_Engine), and [display boards](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Display\_Board).

The [create wiki](https://create.fandom.com/wiki/Create\_Mod\_Wiki) is a good resource for learning more about create.
